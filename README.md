Wanna be like a FISH ? You can now leave underwater !

# Feature :
Can can breath like outside when underwater.
When you'r inside air (Over water, ...) it's like you'r under water, and need to go in water !

# How it works :
Currently it's not using config file, so the name of your world have to start with "**underwater**"
